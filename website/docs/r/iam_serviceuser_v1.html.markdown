# selectel\_iam\_serviceuser\_v1

Creates and manages a service user using public API v1. Selectel products support Identity and Access Management (IAM). For more information about service users, see the [official Selectel documentation](https://docs.selectel.ru/en/control-panel-actions/users-and-roles/user-types-and-roles/).

The `selectel_iam_serviceuser_v1` resource replaces the deprecated `selectel_vpc_user_v2` and `selectel_vpc_role_v2` resources. For additional information, see the [Upgrading Terraform Selectel Provider to version 5.0.0](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/selectel/selectel/latest/docs/guides/upgrading_to_version_5) guide.

Only users with the User administrator role can manage other users.

~> **Note:** The password of the service user is stored as raw data in a plain-text file. Learn more about [sensitive data in state](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/sensitive-data).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "selectel_iam_serviceuser_v1" "serviceuser_1" {
  name        = "username"
  password    = "password"
  role {
    role_name = "member"
    scope     = "account"
  }
  role {
    role_name = "iam_admin"
    scope     = "account"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

    * `project_id` - (Optional) Unique identifier of the associated project. Changing this creates a new service user. If `scope` is `project`, the `project_id` argument is required. Retrieved from the [selectel_vpc_project_v2](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/selectel/selectel/latest/docs/resources/vpc_project_v2) resource.

## Import

You can import a service user:

```shell
export OS_DOMAIN_NAME=<account_id>
export OS_USERNAME=<username>
export OS_PASSWORD=<password>
terraform import selectel_iam_serviceuser_v1.serviceuser_1 <user_id>
```

where:

* `<account_id>` — Selectel account ID. The account ID is in the top right corner of the [Control panel](https://my.selectel.ru/). Learn more about [Registration](https://docs.selectel.ru/en/control-panel-actions/account/registration/).

* `<username>` — Name of the service user. To get the name, in the [Control panel](https://my.selectel.ru/iam/users_management/users?type=service), go to **Identity & Access Management** ⟶ **User management** ⟶ the **Service users** tab ⟶ copy the name of the required user. Learn more about [Service Users](https://docs.selectel.ru/en/control-panel-actions/users-and-roles/user-types-and-roles/).

* `<password>` — Password of the service user.

* `<user_id>` — Unique identifier of the service user to import, for example, `abc1bb378ac84e1234b869b77aadd2ab`. To get the ID, in the [Control panel](https://my.selectel.ru/iam/users_management/users?type=service), go to **Identity & Access Management** ⟶ **User management** ⟶ the **Service users** tab ⟶ copy the ID under the user name.
